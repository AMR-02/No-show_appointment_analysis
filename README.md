# Analyzing No-Show Appointments: Uncovering Patient Demographics and Influential Factors





## Description:
This project investigates the factors contributing to patients missing their scheduled medical appointments using the "No-Show Appointments" dataset from Kaggle. The analysis aims to address two key questions: first, to determine the percentage of male and female patients who do not show up for their appointments and identify the primary age groups within these no-show populations. Second, the project explores various features within the dataset to understand which factors significantly influence a patient's likelihood of missing their medical appointment. By identifying these demographic trends and influential factors, this analysis seeks to provide insights that could potentially help healthcare providers develop strategies to reduce no-show rates and improve appointment adherence.


## Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is the "No-Show Appointments" dataset, obtained from Kaggle [(Healthcare No Shows Appointments Dataset - Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments). This dataset comprises information on over 100,000 medical appointments in Brazil, focusing on the characteristics of patients and their attendance (or non-attendance) at scheduled appointments. Key features include patient demographics (age, gender), appointment details (scheduled day, appointment day, neighbourhood), and various factors potentially influencing attendance, such as scholarship status (Bolsa Fam√≠lia participation), health conditions (hypertension, diabetes, alcoholism, handicap), and SMS reminders. The dataset aims to help predict whether a patient will show up for a medical appointment or not.
